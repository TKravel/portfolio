# Portfolio

[TKDevDesign.com](https://tkdevdesign.com)

My portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript to showcase projects. Client code is hosted on Netlify. The contact form sends a post request to a Express.js server hosted on Heroku. The server then takes the request and forwards it to a Gmail account using Nodemailer.

Server code can be found [here](https://github.com/TKravel/portfolio-server)
